# LIS2DUXS12 Glance and Deglance Gesture Detection on STM32F401RE Nucleo-64 (JSON-Configured FSM)

Detect *glance* and *deglance* gestures typically used in wearable and mobile devices. The gestures are recognized by the sensor's finite state machine (FSM), configured via a JSON-generated register sequence.

This project demonstrates how to interface the **LIS2DUXS12** accelerometer sensor with an **STM32F401RE** microcontroller board. The program configures the sensor FSM using a JSON file converted to Rust code, detects gesture events, and outputs notifications over UART.

## Hardware Setup

- **Microcontroller Board:** STM32F401RE Nucleo-64
- **Sensor:** LIS2DUXS12 Accelerometer with FSM support
- **Communication Interface:** I2C1 at 100 kHz Standard Mode
- **UART:** USART2 for serial output at 115200 baud
- **Interrupt Pin:** PB0 configured as input with external interrupt for FSM event notification

### Default Pin Configuration

| Signal       | STM32F401RE Pin | Description                      |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| I2C1_SCL     | PB8             | I2C clock line (open-drain)     |
| I2C1_SDA     | PB9             | I2C data line (open-drain)      |
| USART2_TX    | PA2             | UART transmit for debug output  |
| EXTI0 (INT)  | PB0             | External interrupt from sensor FSM event |

The LIS2DUXS12 sensor is connected via I2C1 on PB8/PB9. The FSM event interrupt line is connected to PB0, configured to trigger an external interrupt on rising edge. UART output is routed through PA2.

## Code Description

### Initialization

- The program initializes microcontroller peripherals including clocks, GPIO pins, I2C, and UART.
- The I2C bus is configured for 100 kHz Standard Mode with open-drain pins PB8 and PB9.
- UART is configured on PA2 at 115200 baud for serial output.
- PB0 is configured as an input pin and set up to generate an interrupt on rising edge.
- The external interrupt line is enabled in the NVIC and linked to the EXTI0 interrupt handler.
- A global mutex-protected static holds the interrupt pin to clear interrupt flags safely.

### Sensor Setup via JSON Configuration

- The LIS2DUXS12 sensor is initialized over I2C with the high I2C address.
- The sensor is taken out of deep power down mode.
- The device ID is read and verified to confirm sensor presence.
- The sensor is reset to default configuration and waits until reset completes.
- The sensor is configured by applying a sequence of register writes and delays generated by the **`ucf-tool`** from a JSON file (`lis2duxs12_glance_detection.ucf`), which programs the sensor's FSM for gesture detection.
- This approach allows flexible and maintainable sensor configuration by editing JSON files and regenerating Rust code at build time.

### Data Acquisition Loop

- The main loop waits asynchronously for interrupts signaling FSM events.
- When an interrupt occurs, the program reads the sensor's FSM event status.
- If FSM1 event is detected, it reads the FSM output and matches known event codes:
  - `0x20` indicates a "GLANCE" event.
  - `0x08` indicates a "DEGLANCE" event.
- Detected events are printed over UART for monitoring.

## Usage

1. Connect the LIS2DUXS12 sensor to the STM32F401RE Nucleo board via I2C1 (PB8/PB9).
2. Connect the sensor's FSM interrupt line to PB0 on the STM32F401RE.
3. Build the project, which uses the **`ucf-tool`** to generate Rust configuration code from JSON files automatically at build time.
4. Flash the compiled Rust firmware onto the STM32F401RE.
5. Open a serial terminal at 115200 baud on the UART port.
6. Perform glance and deglance gestures with the sensor.
7. Observe event notifications printed over UART.

## Notes

- This example uses polling of interrupts and FSM event registers for gesture detection.
- The **`ucf-tool`** enables flexible sensor FSM configuration by converting JSON files into Rust code.
- The sensor driver and JSON-generated code handle low-level register access and FSM programming.
- The environment is `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` for embedded Rust applications.
- Panic behavior is set to halt on panic (`defmt` and `panic_probe`).
