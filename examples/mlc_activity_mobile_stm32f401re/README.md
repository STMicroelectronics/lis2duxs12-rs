# LIS2DUXS12 Machine Learning Core Activity Recognition on STM32F401RE Nucleo-64 (UCF-Configured MLC)

This example demonstrates how to recognize human activities such as stationary, walking, jogging, biking, and driving using the **LIS2DUXS12** accelerometer sensor's Machine Learning Core (MLC) on an **STM32F401RE** microcontroller board. The MLC is configured via a UCF-generated register sequence, and detected activity events are output over UART.

## Hardware Setup

- **Microcontroller Board:** STM32F401RE Nucleo-64
- **Sensor:** LIS2DUXS12 Accelerometer with Machine Learning Core (MLC)
- **Communication Interface:** I2C1 at 100 kHz Standard Mode
- **UART:** USART2 for serial output at 115200 baud
- **Interrupt Pin:** PB0 configured as input with external interrupt for MLC event notification

### Default Pin Configuration

| Signal       | STM32F401RE Pin | Description                      |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| I2C1_SCL     | PB8             | I2C clock line (open-drain)     |
| I2C1_SDA     | PB9             | I2C data line (open-drain)      |
| USART2_TX    | PA2             | UART transmit for debug output  |
| EXTI0 (INT)  | PB0             | External interrupt from sensor MLC event |

The LIS2DUXS12 sensor is connected via I2C1 on PB8/PB9. The MLC event interrupt line is connected to PB0, configured to trigger an external interrupt on rising edge. UART output is routed through PA2.

## Code Description

### Initialization

- The program initializes microcontroller peripherals including clocks, GPIO pins, I2C, UART, and a timer for delays.
- I2C1 is configured at 100 kHz Standard Mode on pins PB8 (SCL) and PB9 (SDA).
- UART is configured on USART2 (PA2) at 115200 baud for serial output.
- PB0 is configured as an input pin with interrupt on rising edge for MLC event detection.
- The external interrupt is enabled in the NVIC and linked to the EXTI0 interrupt handler.
- The interrupt pin is stored in a mutex-protected static for safe interrupt flag clearing.

### Sensor Setup via UCF Configuration

- The LIS2DUXS12 sensor is initialized over I2C with the high I2C address.
- The sensor is taken out of deep power down mode.
- The device ID is read and verified; if mismatched, the program halts.
- The sensor is reset to default configuration and waits until reset completes.
- The sensor is configured by applying a sequence of register writes and delays defined in the `ACTIVITY` array, generated from a UCF file. This programs the sensor's MLC for activity recognition.

### Data Acquisition Loop

- The program enters a low-power wait-for-interrupt (WFI) loop.
- When an MLC event interrupt occurs, the program reads the MLC status.
- If MLC1 event is detected, it reads the MLC output and matches known activity codes:
  - `0` → "stationary event"
  - `1` → "walking event"
  - `4` → "jogging event"
  - `8` → "biking event"
  - `12` → "driving event"
- Detected activity events are printed over UART.

### Interrupt Handler

- The `EXTI0` interrupt handler clears the interrupt pending bit on PB0 to allow further interrupts.

## Usage

1. Connect the LIS2DUXS12 sensor to the STM32F401RE Nucleo board via I2C1 (PB8/PB9).
2. Connect the sensor's MLC interrupt output to PB0 on the STM32F401RE.
3. Build the project, which uses the **`ucf-tool`** to generate Rust configuration code from UCF files automatically at build time.
4. Flash the compiled Rust firmware onto the STM32F401RE.
5. Open a serial terminal at 115200 baud on the UART port.
6. Perform activities corresponding to the configured gestures.
7. Observe activity event notifications printed over UART.

## Notes

- This example uses polling of interrupts and MLC event registers for activity recognition.
- The **`ucf-tool`** enables flexible sensor MLC configuration by converting UCF files into Rust code.
- The sensor driver and UCF-generated code handle low-level register access and MLC programming.
- The environment is `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` for embedded Rust applications.
- Panic behavior is set to halt on panic (`panic_halt`).
